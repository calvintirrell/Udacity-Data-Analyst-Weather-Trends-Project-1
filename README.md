# Udacity Data Analyst Weather Trends Project 1
This is my repository for the project and files for the first project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

# Description
The goal of this project is to analyze weather data to see if there are any trends between local and global weather patterns.
This project utilized SQL to query the internal database program and download the relevant data to this project.
From there I created 5 day moving averages in Excel as well as some visualizations for comparison purposes.
Lastly, a written report contains a summary of the work done as well as the visualizations and any conclusions and correlations.
